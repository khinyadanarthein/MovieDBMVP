Well, look no further as director Steven Shea trains a surprising lens on all the backstage triumph and tragedy it takes to pull off South Florida’s gigantic Florida Supercon. Surviving Supercon follows owner Mike Broder and his wife and partner Sandy Martin—a “mom & pop” duo—who launched the convention in 2006, inspired by Atlanta’s DragonCon and Orlando’s Spooky Empire, as they run their four-day convention over a weekend of monumental victories and disasters. From crazy celebrity stories, to amazing connections in the wake of unsuspecting tragedy, plus inept security teams and anarchic attendees, the film is a love letter to all the passion and madness it takes to brave a sea of Harley Quinns and deliver a seemingly flawless weekend to the tens of thousands of guests who cross the threshold into a convention center where dreams are made.",

Though falling sometimes into her own depression and anxieties in a time when the world stops and forces people to look into themselves for “renewal” of spirit, body and soul, Nang Em, fights through these negativities. She will show us how it is in the eyes of someone who went through time with grace and reckless abandon. And when an Ilonggo maintenance guy, Tagalog, comes to dip his mundane life into the scene of this wisdom-filled woman, we see how worlds come to connect and fill the gap of these times that don’t seem to mean anything to each other. We realize there is a thin line between old and new for a future set for the taking. Nang Em will open eyes to a whole understanding of being “old” in the time of “new.”",
